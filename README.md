# Fire-Detection-And-Alert-System
IOT Based Project
Fire Detectors play a very important role in Industries, Shops, Malls, Residential complexes, parking areas etc. They help in detecting fire or smoke at an early stage and can help in saving lives. Commercial Fire detecting systems usually have an alarm signalling, with the help of a buzzer or Siren. I have designed an IOT based Fire Alerting System using smoke sensor which would not only signal the presence of fire in a particular premise but will also send related information through IOT.
